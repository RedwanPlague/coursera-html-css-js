In Greek mythology, Medusa, also called Gorgo, was one of the three monstrous Gorgons, generally described as winged human females with living venomous snakes in place of hair. Those who gazed into her eyes would turn to stone. According to Hesiod and Aeschylus, she lived and died on an island named Sarpedon, somewhere near Cisthene.
