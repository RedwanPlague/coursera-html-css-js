Velociraptor was a mid-sized dromaeosaurid, with adults measuring up to 2.07 m (6 ft 9.5 in) long, 0.5 m (1 ft 7.5 in) high at the hip, and weighing up to 15 kg (33 lb), though there is a higher estimate of 19.7 kg (43.5 lb). The skull, which grew up to 25 cm (10 in) long, was uniquely up-curved, concave on the upper surface and convex on the lower.
